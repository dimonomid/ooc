OOC: object-oriented C
======================

This is a simple library that provides generation of "class" templates for C.

Usage
-----

Generate base class `Shape` and subclass `Circle`:

    $ ruby ooc_gen.rb new class shape circle

Generate base class `Shape` and two subclasses: `Circle` and `MyShape`:

    $ ruby ooc_gen.rb new class shape circle myshape:MyShape

After either command, the directory `shape` containing all generated files will
be created in the current directory.

So that, each class name may be specified as just single lowecased
(underscore-separated) word, or as two words separated by colon.

If camelized version isn't provided by user, it is autogenerated, which isn't
always what you want (say, for `myshape` autogenerated version is `Myshape`.
However, if you provide `my_shape`, then it will be converted to `MyShape`).

In order to use generated classes, you also need for `ooc.c` and `ooc.h`, as
well as configuration file `ooc_cfg.h` (initially, just copy default one
`ooc_cfg_default.h` as `ooc_cfg.h` in your project)
